#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) The running time is O(n) over the input size of n.


b) O(n ^ 2) as there is a nested while loop inside a for loop.


c) O(n) linear run time since the fuction is being called recursively n times before reaching the base.

## Exercise II

In order to minize the number of dropped + broken eggs, I would start from the middle similar to a sorted list/binary search tree and throw half of the list away as I look for the value of f. The runtime complexity would be O(n log n).
